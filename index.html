                Tournament for basketball that takes place every year during March.
                In the tournament, 68 teams play each other in a single-elimination shootout.

            <h2>About the Site</h2>
            <p>This site was born out of a personal desire to influence my friends to
                watch the NCAA Tournament. However, with the amount of teams and games
                being played it can be overwhelming for new people to start watching. This
                site will aim to introduce all aspects of the tournament through fun
                interaction and humorous commentary. So if you have a friend you'd like to get into
                March Madness please feel free to <a href = "mailto:cfield@highpoint.edu">SEND</a> them the link to this site.
